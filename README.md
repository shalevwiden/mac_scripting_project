## Mac Scripting Project

This repo has two folders, getuser_project, and mac_app_script.

I imported getuser_project into the script.py in mac_app_script in order to use its code, which greets the user based on their macOS or windows username.

By doing this I was able to understand how importing other files from other folders works in python.

Mac App Script is code for opening and closing apps on a mac. While this is more simple, one could definitely make an elaborate workflow program that would deal with many app opening and closings.
