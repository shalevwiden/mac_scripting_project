## Python App Script

This short script allows you to open and close apps or apps on your computer.
For example, you can automate cycling through a certain collection of apps, just by changing the input to the openapps function.

The openapps function takes a list of app names.
You can use the `get_app_list()` function to get a nicely made list from a .txt file where you put an app name on each line.

### To get app names:

On mac, navigate to your Applications folder in finder, or run these following commands in Terminal:

```bash
cd #goes back to home
cd /Applications
ls #list apps
```
